# HTML Template for Obscura

- Good job on creating the repository and good efforts in creating the html.
- Continuing on let's create a development cycle - this will help us separate code changes and create points in time we can use as reference for changes

## TASK 1 - Organize your file structure

- Organize the file structure into folders

```
/css
/js
/images
```

## TASK 2 - Work in Branches and Create a pull request for all your changes

- Create a branch
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

- Commit your changes
- Push your changes to git

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

- There are certain conventions when naming branches in development teams. For example `hotfix/branch-name` may be used to indicate that a branch is a hotfix - meaning it has to be pushed to production. For your changes - please refer to the Ticket names on asana.

## TASK 3 - Create your first Pull Request

- Create a separate pull request for the resulting changes so I can comment on the specific code lines and guide you much better
